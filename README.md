# Explore Nature - CSS Parallax Scrolling Website

Yesterday, I watched a YouTube video about parallax scrolling website design using CSS. The video was quite useful, and it gave me an idea to recreate a new website landing page by following the guidelines presented in the video.

I downloaded assets from freepik.com and resized and adjusted them using Adobe Illustrator and GIMP. The source code can be found on my GitHub.
